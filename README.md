# Project Overview (156 words)

This project, "Test CSV", is a simple and efficient web application designed to read and display the content of a CSV file, specifically `products.csv`, directly in the browser. The purpose of this application is to provide a quick and easy way to view the CSV file's content without the need for additional software or tools. This could be particularly useful in situations where a user needs to quickly review or verify the data in a CSV file. The application is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight and portable. The context of this application could be any environment where quick and easy access to CSV data is required, such as data analysis, product management, or inventory control. This web application stands out for its simplicity and convenience, providing a straightforward solution to a common need.

# Requirements (102 words)

The evaluation criteria for this project are straightforward: the CSV file, `products.csv`, must exist. This means that the CSV file needs to be located in the same directory as the HTML file. The web application will then fetch this file and display its content. It is crucial that the CSV file is properly formatted, with each data entry separated by a comma and each row separated by a newline. The application will not be able to correctly parse and display the content of the CSV file if it does not follow this format. It is also important that the CSV file is not empty.

# Installation & Setup (153 words)

To install and set up this web application, start by downloading the `index.html` and `products.csv` files. Make sure that you place these two files in the same directory on your local machine. This is important because the JavaScript in `index.html` fetches the `products.csv` file from the local directory.

Next, you will need a web browser to open the `index.html` file. This application has been tested and works properly in modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Simply right-click on the `index.html` file and select 'Open with', then choose your preferred browser.

This application does not require a web server to run, as it fetches the CSV file locally. However, if you prefer to use a web server, you can place the `index.html` and `products.csv` files in your web server's root directory.

# Usage Instructions (150 words)

Using this web application is straightforward. Once you have opened the `index.html` file in your web browser, the application will automatically fetch and display the content of the `products.csv` file. 

The content of the CSV file will be displayed as plain text, with each entry separated by a comma and each row separated by a newline. This way, you can easily see the raw data in the CSV file. 

If you want to view a different CSV file, simply replace the `products.csv` file in the directory with the new CSV file, making sure to rename the new file to `products.csv`. Then, refresh the page in your web browser to see the new CSV file's content. 

In the event of an error while fetching the CSV file, an alert will be displayed in the browser.

# Technical Details (108 words)

The web application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML and CSS provide the basic structure and style of the page. The JavaScript uses the Fetch API to fetch the `products.csv` file from the local directory. 

The application uses a responsive design to ensure that it displays correctly on different screen sizes. This is achieved using CSS flexbox properties.

The JavaScript code includes proper error handling to catch any errors that occur while fetching the CSV file. If an error occurs, an alert is displayed in the browser, and the error details are logged to the console. 

The code is clean and well-commented for ease of understanding and maintenance.

# Troubleshooting (102 words)

If the CSV file content does not display, make sure that the `products.csv` file is in the same directory as the `index.html` file. Also, check that the CSV file is correctly formatted and is not empty.

If you receive an error alert, check the console for error details. The most common issue is a ‘fetch’ error, which occurs when the CSV file cannot be found. Ensure the file is named correctly and in the same location as the HTML file. 

If you encounter any other issues, double-check your setup against the Installation & Setup section, and make sure your browser is up-to-date.
